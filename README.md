## Installation

### Option 1: As a Git Submodule (Recommended)

This method allows you to easily update the theme when new versions are released:

```bash
# Navigate to your Hugo site's root directory
cd your-hugo-site

# Add the theme as a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/owner/hugo-boilerplate.git themes/boilerplate

# Update your Hugo configuration to use the theme
echo 'theme = "boilerplate"' >> hugo.toml
```

### Option 2: Manual Download

If you prefer not to use Git submodules:

```bash
# Navigate to your Hugo site's root directory
cd your-hugo-site

# Download the theme
mkdir -p themes
curl -L https://github.com/owner/hugo-boilerplate/archive/main.tar.gz | tar -xz -C themes
mv themes/hugo-boilerplate-main themes/boilerplate

# Update your Hugo configuration to use the theme
echo 'theme = "boilerplate"' >> hugo.toml
```

## Dependencies

This theme requires Node.js and npm for Tailwind CSS processing. You need to create a `package.json` file in your project root (not in the theme directory) with the necessary dependencies.

You can use the example provided in the theme at `themes/boilerplate/package.json.example`:

```bash
# Copy the example package.json to your project root
cp themes/boilerplate/package.json.example package.json

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

The minimum required dependencies are:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio": "^0.4.2",
    "@tailwindcss/forms": "^0.5.7",
    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.10",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.16",
    "postcss": "^8.4.31",
    "postcss-cli": "^10.1.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.5"
  }
}
```

## PostCSS Configuration

### Required Setup

This theme uses Tailwind CSS which requires PostCSS for processing. You **must** create a `postcss.config.js` file in your project root (not in the theme directory) with the following content:

```javascript
// postcss.config.js in your project root
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {
      config: './themes/boilerplate/tailwind.config.js'
    },
    autoprefixer: {}
  }
}
```

This configuration tells PostCSS to:
1. Use the Tailwind CSS plugin with the configuration file located in the theme directory
2. Apply autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility

### Troubleshooting PostCSS Issues

If you encounter errors related to PostCSS processing (such as `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'blocklist')`), check the following:

1. Ensure your `postcss.config.js` is in the project root, not just in the theme directory
2. Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly with `npm install`
3. Make sure the path to the Tailwind config file is correct relative to your project structure
4. Check for any path resolution issues in your project's JavaScript configuration files

### Advanced PostCSS Configuration

For advanced users who want to customize the PostCSS processing:

```javascript
// postcss.config.js with additional options
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-import': {},
    'tailwindcss/nesting': {},
    tailwindcss: {
      config: './themes/boilerplate/tailwind.config.js'
    },
    autoprefixer: {
      flexbox: 'no-2009'
    },
    'postcss-preset-env': {
      features: { 'nesting-rules': false }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Add the following to your `hugo.toml` file:

```toml
baseURL = 'https://example.com/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'Your Site Title'
theme = 'boilerplate'
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
defaultContentLanguageInSubdir = true

# Output formats configuration
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "SITEMAP"]

# Site parameters
[params]
  description = "Your site description"
  author = "Your Name"
  mainSections = ["blog"]
  dateFormat = "January 2, 2006"
```

### Multilingual Setup

The theme supports multiple languages out of the box. Configure them in your `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[languages]
  [languages.en]
    languageName = "English"
    title = "English Site Title"
    weight = 1
    contentDir = "content/en"
    baseURL = "https://example.com"
    bcp47Lang = "en-us"
    [languages.en.params]
      description = "English site description"
      flag = "🇺🇸"

  [languages.de]
    languageName = "Deutsch"
    title = "Deutsche Site Title"
    weight = 2
    contentDir = "content/de"
    baseURL = "https://example.de"
    bcp47Lang = "de"
    [languages.de.params]
      description = "Deutsche Seitenbeschreibung"
      flag = "🇩🇪"
```

### Image Processing Configuration

For optimal image processing, add the following to your `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params.imaging]
  resampleFilter = "Lanczos"
  quality = 85
  anchor = "smart"
  bgColor = "#ffffff"
  webpQuality = 85
```

## Content Structure

```bash
hugo new content/en/blog/my-post.md

### Creating Glossary Terms

ctaDescription = "Call to action description text"
ctaPrimaryText = "Primary Button"
ctaPrimaryURL = "/related-url/"
ctaSecondaryText = "Secondary Button"
ctaSecondaryURL = "/another-url/"

[[faq]]
question = "Frequently asked question about the term?"
answer = "Comprehensive answer to the question that provides valuable information about the term."

## Using Theme Components

## Customization

### Tailwind Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PostCSS Processing Errors**: Ensure you have the correct PostCSS configuration in your project root.
